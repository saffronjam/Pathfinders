# AStarVisualization
Visualizing the path-finding algorithm A*, both with square-tiles and Voronoi-polygons.

This is a simple program visualizing A* path finding algorithm.
It is interactive such that obstacles can be placed, and start and goal can be moved around freely.
The visualization can be ran in both a square grid and in a polyogon map (Voronoi-polygons).
