# AStarVisualization
Visualizing the path-finding algorithm A*, both with square-tiles and Voronoi-polygons.

This is a simple program visualizing A* path finding algorithm.
It is interactive such that obstacles can be placed, and start and goal can be moved around freely.
The visualization can be ran in both a square grid and in a polyogon map (Voronoi-polygons).

## Setting up
### Linux
<b> 1. </b> Install SFML using <i>sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev</i>

<b> 2. </b> Run command <i>make br</i> (See "MakeFile")

### Windows
<b> 1. </b> Download SFML-dev pack from <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php">here</a>

<b> 2. </b> Compile the .exe-file using roughly the same command as <i>make br</i> in "MakeFile" but change the .lib-location to where you put the files

### Mac
Should be similar to Linux ;)
